# Farmhand

Farmhand is a command-line tool that allows you to execute commands and run
files on remote devices using DeviceFarmer's API and ADB. It simplifies the
process of connecting to devices, pushing files, running commands, and
retrieving results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- ADB installed and added to the system's PATH
- DeviceFarmer API token
- JSON configuration file containing the Swagger spec URL and DeviceFarmer API
  token

## Installation

NOTE: Farmhand is developed on and regularly tested with Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.8.
Other distributions and versions may work, but are currently untested.

1. Clone the repository

2. Install required dependencies

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-venv python3.8-venv -y
python3.8 -m venv bg_venv
source bg_venv/bin/activate
(bg_venv) pip install --upgrade pip
(bg_venv) pip install .
```

3. Create a [configuration file](#configuration-file)

### Configuration File

Farmhand utilizes a JSON configuration file. The default location for this
config file is in the `.farmhand` directory within the user's home directory
(~/.farmhand/config.json). The configuration file is used to specify the
following:
   - device_farmer_url: The URL of the DeviceFarmer instance.
     * NOTE: Farmhand will append the standard API JSON spec to the base url. If
       using a custom path for your spec file, specify a full url ending in
       .json or .yaml.
   - access_token: Your DeviceFarmer access token.
     * This can be obtained by logging into your DeviceFarmer UI, and going to
       Settings->Keys->Access Tokens
   - adb_private_key_path: (Optional) Path to non default adb private key.
     Defaults to ~/.android/adbkey if not specified

```json
{
   "access_token": "12345",
   "device_farmer_url": "https://my.device-farmer-instance.com/",
   "adb_private_key_path": "/custom/path/adb.key"
}
```

## Usage

```
usage: farmhand.py [-h] [-g | -e EXEC_FILE | -c COMMAND] [--config CONFIG] [-s SELECT [SELECT ...]] [-f FILTER_DEVICES [FILTER_DEVICES ...]] [-p PUSH_FILES]

DeviceFarmer automation tool

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g, --get-devices     Enumerate devices on DeviceFarmer instance. Does not execute any commands on devices. Prints JSON results to stdout.
  -e EXEC_FILE, --exec-file EXEC_FILE
                        Push a file and execute it. Pushes to /data/local/tmp.
  -c COMMAND, --command COMMAND
                        Run a command.
  --config CONFIG       Override the default path to the configuration file. Default: ~/.farmhand/config.json.
  -s SELECT [SELECT ...], --select SELECT [SELECT ...]
                        Select the fields to be returned by --get-devices (-g). If not specified, all fields are returned.
  -f FILTER_DEVICES [FILTER_DEVICES ...], --filter-devices FILTER_DEVICES [FILTER_DEVICES ...]
                        Filter devices via a list of key-value pairs (e.g., key1=val1 key2=val2). Non boolean values are regex matched.
  -p PUSH_FILES, --push-files PUSH_FILES
                        Specify the path to the file or directory to be pushed to the device. Pushes to /data/local/tmp.
```

### Device Fields

The `--select` and `--filter-devices` options both use "field names" to perform
their respective actions. These field names are JSON keys as defined by
DeviceFarmer as part of its REST API. You can view supported fields for your
DeviceFarmer installation by navigating to the following URL:
"https://<device_farmer_url>/api/v1/devices/<serial>" where `device_farmer_url`
is the URL to your DeviceFarmer installation and `serial` is the serial number
of one of your devices. The `/<serial>` component can be dropped to view all
fields of all devices.

Field names support dot notation to access nested keys. For example,
`battery.health` can be used to access the nested `health` key within `battery`.

Note that specifying a `--filter` along with a `--select` will automatically
include any field names specified in the filter in the resulting JSON.

#### Commonly Used Fields

| Field Name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| abi | Device Application Binary Interface (eg. `armeabi-v7a`) |
| manufacturer | Device Manufacturer |
| marketName | Device Marketing Name |
| model | Device Model Name |
| provider.name | STF Provider hosting this device |
| version | Android version


### Examples

* Enumerate all devices on DeviceFarmer instance:

```sh
python farmhand.py --get-devices
```

* Limit the fields returned by `--get-devices`:

```sh
python farmhand.py --get-devices --select serial model status
```

* Filter devices based on specific fields and values (All Samsung SDK level
  25-27):

```sh
python farmhand.py --get-devices --filter-devices manufacturer=SAMSUNG sdk=2[5-7]
```

* Filter devices based on JSON sub-key using dot notation:

```sh
python farmhand.py --get-devices --filter-devices provider.name=my.devicefarmer.com
```

* Push a file to the device and execute it:

```sh
python farmhand.py --exec-file path/to/hello
```

* Run a command on all arm64 devices:

```sh
python farmhand.py --command "echo hello" --filter abi=arm64-v8a
```

* Push files to the device:

```sh
python farmhand.py --push-files path/to/files
```

### Results

Farmhand returns results for each device that an action was performed on.

The following is an example of sample output for the command

```sh
python farmhand.py --command "echo hello" --filter abi=arm64-v8a

"A12345": {
    "output": "hello",
    "exitcode": 0,
    "available": true
},
"B54321": {
    "output": "hello",
    "exitcode": 0,
    "available": true
},
"C678910": {
    "available": false,
    "output": "Failed to lock device",
    "exitcode": null
}
```

Each result contains the following fields:

* `available` -  Whether or not the device was available for this action.
* `output` - The resultant ADB shell output of the command _or_ details about
  action performed
* `exitcode` - return code of command or action. Null if no action performed.

Please note: An unavailable device can happen if a device is locked, or if it is
not present on DeviceFarmer at the time the operations were performed.

## Docker Image

For convenience, an official Farmhand Docker image is provided.

To use the docker image, simply run

```sh
docker run --rm -v ~/.android:/root/.android -v ~/.farmhand:/root/.farmhand zetier/farmhand:latest -c 'echo hello'
```

This command will mount your .android and .farmhand dirs, with your ADB keys and
farmhand configuration file into the image and run. If your keys and
configuration file exist elsewhere, you may need to modify the docker run
command.

## CI Integration

Farmhand was designed for simple integration into your CI pipelines. Below is
an example of a Gitlab job that tests a binary on your Device Farmer range:

```yml
.farmhand-test:
  image: zetier/farmhand:latest
    entrypoint: [""]
  stage: test
  before_script:
    # Copy keys and configs from CI variables
    - mkdir -p ~/.android
    - echo "$ADB_PUB_CI_VAR" > ~/.android/adbkey.pub
    - echo "$ADB_PRI_CI_VAR" > ~/.android/adbkey
    - echo "$FARMHAND_CONFIG_CI_VAR" -> ~/farmhand_config.json
  script:
    - python3 farmhand.py --file $BINARY > test_results.json
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - test_results.json

android_test:
  extends: .farmhand-test
  variables:
    BINARY: my_android_binary
```

## Notes

- Farmhand will lock the devices before performing any operations to ensure
  exclusive access. After the operation is completed, the devices will be
  unlocked.
- Make sure to provide the correct path to the ADB private key file via
  `farmhand_config.json` if it is different from the default location
  (~/.android/adbkey)
- By default, Farmhand will enumerate ~every~ device on the DeviceFarmer range,
  including ones not `present` or `ready`. You can modify this as needed by
  specifying `--filter ready=true present=true` if needed.
